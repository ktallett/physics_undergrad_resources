Here are the guides for year 1 of a Physics BsC, seperated by semester, class and then by week. 

This is just a starting point, feel free to tailor the course as you wish. This guide is focused on being an aid for University students studying Physics so the pacing may seem a little extreme, also the workload is greater in semester 1. Be aware this guide may not fit your course perfectly so adapt it as you see fit. 

Should you be self studying then go ahead and extended the length of the semester, learning fewer concepts per week. This isn't a race. 

In the future, I will adapt this guide to be optimal both time management and content wise. 

**Still to add the computational and experimental classes.**
